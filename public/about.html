<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Atharva Anna Kale, and I hail from Airoli, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. I am currently 
  pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Indian Institute 
  of Information Technology (IIIT) Vadodara. Presently, I am in my third year of study.

<p>
  I excel in academics, boasting a commendable CPI of 7.97. Proficient in programming languages such 
  as C and Java, I've also mastered essential computer science concepts like data structures and 
  algorithms, object-oriented programming, operating systems, and database management. My expertise 
  extends to programming in Verilog, where I demonstrate proficiency. Presently, I'm delving into the 
  realm of web development, eager to expand my skill set further in this domain.

  I am a slow learner, but I have a strong capacity to retain information over extended periods. 
  While I consider myself average in many skills, I am actively working to improve them. When assigned 
  a task, I approach it with honesty and dedication, ensuring its completion before the deadline. 
  However, I do struggle with procrastination and often find myself starting work only when under 
  pressure. Nevertheless, I am actively working to overcome this weakness.
